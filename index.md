# Griffith Library Workshop Template

{% include figure.html img="university-drive.jpg" alt="Students on University Drive, Gold Coast Campus" caption="University Drive" width="75%" %}

A minimal Jekyll theme with Bootstrap for creating workshop websites.

> Customised from Evan Williamsons's original Workshop-Template-B to include Griffith Library author and analytics info. This version reflects the November 2021 version of the template that uses Bootstrap 5 and has some new features, as well as the use of Bootstrap icons instead of FontAwesome.

*Add your workshop abstract here!*

Learn how to create a super quick easy website for a workshop by writing a few markdown files! 
Host it for free on GitHub with gh-pages, and share!
Fun!
